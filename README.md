Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This is an interesting react based web-app where someone can see various sorting algorithms in action! The array of numbers is represented by a column graph, implemented with the help of google charts. One can select the size of arrray and can see visually how the numbers are being sorted. Used await, promise and settimeout in javascript for creating the animation effect.
